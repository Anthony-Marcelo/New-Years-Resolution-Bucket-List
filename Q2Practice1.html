	<h1 id="health"> Improve Mental & Physical Health </i></h1>
		<br>
		<p> Alright, let's get into the first one. "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Improve Mental & Physical Health</span>" is probably a common New Years Resolution.</p>
		<br>
		<p> I guess the main reason I chose this to be my first New Years Resolution is that I've been struggling to keep my mental health up for the entirety of 2023. Slowly but surely, it's also been affecting my physical health. I know that if I continue to keep ignoring it and letting it "try to fix itself", I'll end up broken and worse than before. Talk about a real dark start right? </p>

	<h1 id="story"> Write more stories </i></h1>
		<br>
		<p> Moving away from dark topics. "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Write more stories</span>" is something I really wanna do this year.</p>
		<br>
		<p> In 2023, I've made atleast 3 stories. The ones I can name from the top of my head are My Death Bed, A Ghost's Greetings and Zm Zmmrevihzib which are all oneshot stories in some way or form. I've also made numerous concepts for stories, designing characters, making the plot but usually i do them all inside my head. An example of those would be The Institute and Elf Academia which both feature school-like environments. I really wish I can put them onto paper or onto the desired medium I wanna potray them in. If you want one of the story's links, here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MLrSZDd967BLz0yu2HPpriSnyyyqBf-3Q8WG9pKAXC8/edit?usp=sharing" style="color: lightgray;">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MLrSZDd967BLz0yu2HPpriSnyyyqBf-3Q8WG9pKAXC8/edit?usp=sharing</a>. That's My Death Bed. </p>

		<br>
		<p> Following up, "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Make friends with the people I want to be friends with</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> Self-explanatory. There's a lot of people I want to be friends with but out of shyness, I am unable to. I want to try to make friends with them this year though! </p>

		<br>
		<p> Proceeding to... "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pursue my interests more</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> I honestly have a lot of interests. I guess the ones that stand out the most to me right now are figure skating and coding. My love for figure skating was sparked by the anime Yuri!!! on Ice and I honestly want to see if I might have a future in that area (which I'll expound on later.) </p>

		<p> Next up! "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Try out for the Volleyball Varsity</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> Another sporty interest of mine inspired by an anime (this time it was Haikyuu!!). I guess you can probably tell I'm very into sports. </p>

		<br>
		<p> Brace yourself for another heavy one. "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Let go of guilt</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> Over 2021, 2022, and 2023, I have accumulated so much guilt over various things and it's been weighing down on me heavily. I really wish I could let go of all of it with a click of a button but that isn't happening, so until then, I'll try letting it go over time. </p>

	<h1 id="slack"> Give myself more slack </i></h1>
		<br>
		<p> Proceeding on to "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Give myself more slack</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> I honestly probably needed this for last year too. I often find myself working late hours into the night and waking up too early to get any form of proper rest just in order to finish something (which is often academically related.) This problem definitely shows itself in its worst form when it comes to ICT. Even last year, I always overworked myself for my projects and requirements, (and while yes, I find coding fun and I like doing it,) it lead to me neglecting my health and overall coming out with projects that were half-baked for grade 8 and for grade 9, it lead to me working late at night trying to finish my code which was due in, give or take, 6 hours. Yeah, it sucks but I really want to stop that habit. There are underlying reasons as to why I do this but I will not expound on them today. </p>

	<h1 id="hangouts"> Have more hangouts with my friends </i></h1>
		<br>
		<p> Back to the lighter bits! "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Have more hangouts with my friends</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> Yeah, pretty self-explanatory. I really enjoy just hanging out with my friends and it boosts my mental health. </p>

		<br>
		<p> ...and time to expound on something I already said earlier: "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure out my career path</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> I've been thinking about it starting around Christmas of last year and right now, I only see myself going down career paths for sports. Volleyball and Figure Skating are definitely big contenders here. Aside from that though, I could technically do anything with how fast I am able to learn and adapt to whatever's thrown at me. </p>

		<br>
		<p> Lastly, "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Enjoy 2024 more than I enjoyed 2023, 2022, and 2021</span>".</p>
		<br>
		<p> You probably know why I didn't have such a great time during the last three years. I guess that this year, I'm hoping with all my heart that it'll change. Though, I'd like to thank those three years for setting the benchmark of how terrible my life could be, so thanks 2021, 2022, and 2023. For now though, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Happy New Years!</span> </p>
